      "At the Hudson Gateway Association of REALTORS®, we come to work every day to help REALTORS thrive. We think REALTORS are the unsung heroes of the neighborhoods we live, work and play in, because they drive the economy, help people realize the dream of homeownership and fiercely protect their clients.\n",
      "Unequivocally committed. Whether you work in real estate or just stopped by our site to find out about how to become a REALTOR, we’d like you to know that we’re unequivocally committed to helping our members thrive.\n",
      "\n",
      "92 percent of member dues are spent on member services. Many people don’t realize that REALTORS are, by and large, independent contractors. That means that when they choose to be a member of HGAR, they’re investing their hard-earned money into our association. We never forget that, and it’s why we spend 92 percent of every member dollar on member services.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tools and data. Our job is to give our members the tools and resources that will help them work with their customers and clients effectively. With access to the Multiple Listing Service our members and their clients have access to 100 percent accurate data, 100 percent of the time so that everyone can make informed decisions. We live and breathe real estate data so that our members can do their jobs with confidence.\n",

      "Our History\n",
      "HGAR has served the New York real estate community since 1916, though not always under the name Hudson Gateway. We are the proud result of six local New York associations coming together to build a better, bigger and stronger organization for our members.\n",
      "The oldest association in our history, the Westchester County Realty Board, was founded in 1916 in White Plains. In 1929, we published the first edition of the Westchester Realtor Magazine, whose successor publication, Real Estate In-Depth, began publishing in 1996.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1947, the Pelham Realty Board merged with us. But in 2009, the pace of consolidation took on speed, first with the Putnam County Association of Realtors, followed by the Rockland County Board of Realtors and the Orange County Association of Realtors in 2011.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s also when we became formally known as the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors and MLS.\n",
      "In 2016, the Manhattan Association of Realtors merged with HGAR, increasing our coverage area to include the city with accurate data and world-class education and services.\n",
      "\n",
      "How We Do Business\n",
      "Gratitude. Every member of HGAR matters and is served accordingly.\n",
      "Purpose. Our mission is to help you thrive. We are at your side.\n",
      "Focus. We put the needs of residential real estate brokers first.\n",
      "Efficiency. We spend 92 percent of dues on services that directly benefit members.\n",
      "Ethics. We are governed by the National Association of REALTORS® Code of Ethics.\n",
      "Leadership. Our board is comprised of working brokers, elected by the membership.\n",

Immediately after graduation, he began working in the lending industry initially as an underwriter and soon thereafter, as a loan consultant. Frustrated with the bureaucracy and inherent corporate structure; he decided to pursue his Mortgage Broker certification so that he could open his own company where the “client and THEIR needs would always come first.” And in 2000, he did exactly that when he opened “Global Mortgage.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Since 2000, Global Mortgage has been providing its clients with excellent service and performance. Amir values providing a personal touch with each transaction- buying a new home or refinancing one’s current home is a daunting, at times overwhelming, and certainly a complex process. Amir focuses his attention on the education of the client encouraging them to ask any questions and happily explaining the various vocabulary, regulations, and the financing process. He also asks a lot of questions because he is committed to understanding each client’s unique situation before recommending any lending strategy. Only then, can he wisely create a successful financing structure that is beneficial to the client and their needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result, he is rewarded with continued business with many clients and also the opportunity to serve their referrals. There is no greater thank you than that; his clients know that when they send their friends to Global Mortgage, they will be treated respectfully, listened to, and they too will receive the benefits of a seasoned professional.\n",
